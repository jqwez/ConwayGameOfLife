Experimenting with zero-player rules based on Mr. Conway's "Life"

This is a result of a wiki dive on programming languages and what makes one "Turing Complete." After coming upon the "Conway's Game of Life" article on Wikipedia, I decided that the rules were easy enough and the results fascinating enough for me to code up from the ground up. I originally worked on this on replit.com as I did it during breaks and lunch hours while at work where I do not have access to my regular IDE. I had a lot of fun and think it was a good learning experience. Up until completing what I think was the original intent of the game, I did not look at any examples or similar projects so please excuse the rough code. 

On 05/05/2022, I tested this with various oscillators and spaceships and now consider this correct and complete to the initial intent of the "Life," but I would like to tool around and add some fun features in the future. I am considering adding event listeners and buttons so that the viewer can modify the inital state before sending the automation sequence off.
